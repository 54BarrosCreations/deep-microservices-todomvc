##Windows configuration
  1. Before starting you should have installed and configured correctly node and npm (versions more than 4.2.4 are supported).
  2. Before starting you should install Git Bash.
> It launches a full featured console window running Bash, so you can use Git as well as a set of common command line tools or Unix programs.
> Starting with Git version 2, Git Bash will by default launch in MinTTY, a terminal emulator which comes with MSYS2, making it easily usable even for users not accustomed to a console experience.
    2.1. Download and launch installer for [Git Bash](http://git-scm.com/).

  3. All commands should be run from MinTTY.
  4. Optionally: you need to have the AWS CLI installed and configured to your [AWS account](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/cli-chap-getting-started.html) otherwise you will need to enter your credentials manually.
