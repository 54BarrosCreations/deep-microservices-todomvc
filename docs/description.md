deep-microservices-todo-app is a sample microservice inspired from [todomvc.com](http://todomvc.com).
It is built on top of [DEEP Framework](https://github.com/MitocGroup/deep-framework) and reuses
[TodoMVC AngularJS Example](https://github.com/tastejs/todomvc/tree/master/examples/angularjs). This
repository is open sourced to show case how developers can build and deploy hassle-free cloud-native
web applications using microservices architecture and serverless computing.
